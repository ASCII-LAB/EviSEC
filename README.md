## Abstract
In this study, we explore **Out-of-Distribution Detection in Dynamic Graphs** and analyze it using **Evidential Deep Learning**. We employ the 6 datasets in three download task and implement our methods for a comprehensive analysis of results. Specifically, we propose EviSEC, an innovative and effective OOD detector via Evidential Spectrum-awarE Contrastive Learning. 

## Dataset
6 datasets were used in the paper:
|                     | **# Nodes** | **# Edges** | **# Time Splits** | **Task** |

## Code Execution Method

To reproduce this study, the following code execution methods were used:

### 1. Conda Environment Requirements
- Python version: 3.6.13
- Dependencies:
  
  ```$ conda create --name <env> python=3.6.13 --file environment.txt```

  ```$ pip install -r requestment.txt```

  * if Command errored with "torch-sparse" and "torch_scatter", download them in https://pytorch-geometric.com/whl/torch-1.10.1%2Bcu113.html *


### 2. Data Preprocessing
- The code performs data preprocessing, including data OOD (SM and FI).
- We already uploaded the processed data.

### 3. Usage (Our model uses `----EDL evisec` as part of the command line arguments.)
 - ```
   python run_exp.py --config_file ./experiments/EC_BTCAlpha.yaml --OOD FI
   python run_exp.py --config_file ./experiments/EC_BTCAlpha.yaml --OOD SM
   python run_exp.py --config_file ./experiments/EC_BTCAlpha.yaml --EDL evisec --OOD FI
   python run_exp.py --config_file ./experiments/EC_BTCAlpha.yaml --EDL evisec --OOD SM
   ```
